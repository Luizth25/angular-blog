# AniBlog
This project is a blog created with Angular based on the layout taken from the dribble site. It has news about some anime that I find interesting.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
